            At Luxzure Trucking Services, our goal is to provide excellent
            trucking services to our customers. The company was established in
            2013, and expanded in 2016, after Kyle Uy, a Cebuano businessman,
            saw the need for a reliable partner in the trucking industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since then, Luxzure has built its reputation on dependable
            execution. We take pride in providing satisfaction through our
            well-regulated operations, and the outstanding cleanliness and
            efficiency of our equipment and vehicles. We ensure that our team is
            composed of safety-trained and service-oriented drivers, who operate
            a well-maintained fleet of trucks, ready to serve local and offshore
            operations. All our equipment and vehicles are serviced regularly by
            out team of professionals, ensuring that there is no breakdown or
            mechanical issues that can affect delivery.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a result, with our fleet of six-wheeler closed vans, ten-wheeler
            wing vans, and prime movers with trailers, we have delivered
            thousands of goods all over the nation to our customerâ€™s
            satisfaction. Since 2013, we have delivered throughout the
            Philippines with thousands of kilometers safely traveled for our
            clients.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are based in Cebu, as we continue to serve and grown our
            client-base throughout the Philippines, using our knowledge within
            the trucking industry, and by continuously re-affirming our
            commitment to our customers.

              Finding opportunities and delivering on our commitments, as our

              <br />
              We began our story when Kyle Uy found opportunities to gain a
              foothold in the trucking industry. Kyle utilized his expertiese in
              the field, gained through his experience and exposure to te
              trucking and heavy equipment importation business, through his
              family's long business history in the industry, to build, expand,
              and continue to imporve operations and increase the company's
              customer base. With his belief that one's reputation for
              excellence and customer-service will build his business, Luxzure
              continues to grow as a reliable partner in the transportation
              industry.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our hard work means that we adapat to technology, respond to new
              demands of the market, and learn new ways of doing things. We
              continue to produce results and keep our customers' trust, because
              we believe that our word is as good as a contract. That good is
              not good, where excellence is expected. That there is no better
              signature, than a job well done.
              <br />
              <br />
              We push forward, always.
              <br />
              <br />
              These are words we live by.
